        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-3">Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          OpenedFile was created with a simple mission: <strong>make file conversion private, free, and instant</strong>.
          We believe you shouldn't have to upload sensitive documents, personal photos, or confidential email attachments
          to a remote server just to convert them into a usable format.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          Every day, millions of people encounter files they can't open — WebP images downloaded from the web, HEIC photos
          from iPhones, or mysterious winmail.dat attachments from Outlook. Most online converters require you to upload
          these files to their servers, where they may be stored, analyzed, or shared without your knowledge. We built
          OpenedFile to provide a better alternative.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-3">Why Client-Side Processing?</h2>
        <p>
          Privacy is not just a feature — it's the foundation of everything we do. All of our tools run entirely within
          your web browser. When you convert a file on OpenedFile, the processing happens on your device using technologies
          like JavaScript, WebAssembly, and the HTML5 Canvas API. Your files are never uploaded to any server. Not ours,
          not anyone else's.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          This approach has several important benefits:
        </p>
        <ul class="mt-3 space-y-2 list-disc pl-6">
          <li><strong>Complete Privacy:</strong> Your files never leave your device. There's no risk of data breaches,
            unauthorized access, or third-party sharing because your data never travels over the internet.</li>
          <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Since there's no upload or download step, conversions are nearly instant. The speed
            depends only on your device's processing power, not your internet connection.</li>
          <li><strong>Works Offline:</strong> Once the page has loaded, most of our tools work without an internet
            connection. Your files can be converted even on an airplane or in areas with poor connectivity.</li>
          <li><strong>No File Size Limits:</strong> Server-based converters often impose strict file size limits. Our
            tools are limited only by your device's available memory, allowing you to process much larger files.</li>
          <li><strong>No Registration:</strong> You don't need to create an account, provide an email address, or sign
            up for anything. Just open the tool and start converting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-3">How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          Our tools leverage modern web technologies to perform all file processing directly in your browser:
        </p>
        <ul class="mt-3 space-y-2 list-disc pl-6">
          <li><strong>HTML5 Canvas API:</strong> Used for image format conversion (WebP to JPG/PNG), providing native
            browser support for encoding and decoding image formats.</li>
          <li><strong>WebAssembly (Wasm):</strong> Used for HEIC/HEIF decoding, enabling near-native performance for
            complex image processing tasks that would be too slow in pure JavaScript.</li>
          <li><strong>Custom TNEF Parser:</strong> Our winmail.dat tool uses a purpose-built TypeScript parser that
            decodes the binary TNEF format, extracts MAPI properties, and correctly handles multi-byte character
            encodings like Shift_JIS and UTF-16LE.</li>
          <li><strong>DOMPurify:</strong> HTML email content from winmail.dat files is sanitized using DOMPurify before
            being displayed in a sandboxed iframe, ensuring security even with potentially malicious email content.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-3">What's Next</h2>
