        <p>
          OpenedFile ("we", "us", or "our") operates the website <strong>openedfile.com</strong>. We are committed to
          protecting your privacy and being transparent about how we handle your data. This Privacy Policy explains what
          information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your personal data.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          By using our website, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you
          do not agree with any part of this policy, please do not use our services.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-3">2. How We Handle Your Files</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Your files are never uploaded to our servers.</strong> All file conversion and processing on OpenedFile
          happens entirely within your web browser using client-side technologies such as JavaScript, WebAssembly, and the
          HTML5 Canvas API. When you use any of our tools — whether converting WebP images, HEIC photos, or opening
          winmail.dat files — your files remain on your device at all times.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          We do not have access to, collect, store, or transmit any files that you process using our tools. No file data
          passes through our servers. This design is fundamental to our service and ensures complete privacy for your
          documents, images, and other files.
        </p>
