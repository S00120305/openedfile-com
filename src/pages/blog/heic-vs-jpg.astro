  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    If you own an iPhone or have received photos from someone who does, you have almost certainly
    encountered HEIC files. This relatively new image format has been the default on Apple devices
    since 2017, yet many people are still unsure how it compares to the ubiquitous JPG format that
    has dominated digital photography for over three decades. Understanding the differences between
    HEIC and JPG is essential for anyone who works with digital images, whether you are a
    professional photographer, a web developer, or simply someone who takes photos on a smartphone.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this comprehensive comparison guide, we will break down everything you need to know about
    HEIC and JPG, from file size and image quality to compatibility and special features, so you
    can make an informed decision about which format best suits your needs.
  </p>

  <h2>What Is HEIC?</h2>
  <p>
    HEIC stands for High Efficiency Image Container. It is a file format based on the HEIF (High
    Efficiency Image Format) standard, which was developed by the Moving Picture Experts Group
    (MPEG) and finalized in 2015. HEIC files use HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding), also known
    as H.265, as their underlying compression codec. This is the same advanced compression
    technology used in modern 4K and 8K video streaming.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apple adopted HEIC as the default image format for iPhones and iPads starting with iOS 11 in
    2017. The format was chosen specifically because it delivers significantly better compression
    than JPG while maintaining equal or superior image quality. Beyond simple photographs, the
    HEIC container can also store image sequences, depth maps, alpha channels (transparency),
    and auxiliary image data such as HDR gain maps.
  </p>

  <h2>What Is JPG?</h2>
  <p>
    JPG, also referred to as JPEG, stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the committee that
    created the standard in 1992. It is arguably the most widely used image format in the world and
    has been the backbone of digital photography and web imagery for over 30 years. JPG uses DCT
    (Discrete Cosine Transform) based lossy compression to reduce file sizes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The format's greatest strength has always been its universal compatibility. Virtually every
    device, application, web browser, and operating system in existence can open and display JPG
    files without any additional software. This level of interoperability is unmatched by any
    other image format.
  </p>

  <h2>File Size Comparison: HEIC Is Roughly 50% Smaller</h2>
  <p>
    The most significant advantage of HEIC over JPG is file size. At equivalent visual quality,
    HEIC files are typically <strong>40% to 50% smaller</strong> than their JPG counterparts.
    This is a substantial difference that has real-world implications for storage and bandwidth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consider a typical 12-megapixel iPhone photo. Saved as a JPG, the file might be around
    3 to 5 MB. The same image saved as HEIC would be approximately 1.5 to 2.5 MB. Over hundreds
    or thousands of photos, this adds up to gigabytes of saved storage space. For a 128 GB iPhone,
    this can mean the difference between running out of storage and having plenty of room.
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason for this dramatic size reduction is the underlying HEVC codec. While JPG's DCT
    compression operates on fixed 8x8 pixel blocks, HEVC uses variable-size coding tree units
    that can be as large as 64x64 pixels. This allows the codec to represent large areas of
    similar content far more efficiently. HEVC also employs more sophisticated intra-prediction
    algorithms with 35 directional modes compared to JPG's much simpler prediction model.
  </p>

  <h2>Image Quality Comparison</h2>
  <p>
    When comparing image quality at the <strong>same file size</strong>, HEIC consistently
    outperforms JPG. HEIC images retain more fine detail, produce fewer compression artifacts,
    and handle gradients and smooth color transitions more gracefully. The blocking artifacts that
    are characteristic of heavily compressed JPG files are largely absent in HEIC images at
    similar compression ratios.
  </p>
  <p>
    When comparing at the <strong>same visual quality</strong>, both formats can produce
    essentially identical-looking images to the human eye. The difference is that HEIC achieves
    this quality at roughly half the file size. In practical terms, this means HEIC gives you
    more quality per byte than JPG.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is worth noting that both HEIC and JPG support various quality levels. Higher quality
    settings in either format will produce larger files with fewer artifacts. The advantage of
    HEIC is that its "floor" of quality at any given file size is higher than JPG's.
  </p>

  <h2>Compatibility Differences</h2>
  <p>
    This is where JPG has a clear and decisive advantage. JPG is universally supported across
    every platform, browser, and application. HEIC, on the other hand, has limited support
    outside the Apple ecosystem:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>macOS:</strong> Native support since macOS High Sierra (10.13)</li>
    <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Native support since iOS 11</li>
    <li><strong>Windows:</strong> Requires installing the free HEIF Image Extensions from the Microsoft Store; HEVC Video Extensions may cost a small fee</li>
    <li><strong>Android:</strong> Partial support from Android 9 onward, but varies significantly by device manufacturer</li>
    <li><strong>Linux:</strong> Requires installing libheif and associated libraries</li>
    <li><strong>Web browsers:</strong> Only Safari supports HEIC natively; Chrome, Firefox, and Edge do not</li>
    <li><strong>Social media:</strong> Most platforms automatically convert uploads, but some older systems may reject HEIC files</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For sharing images widely or publishing on the web, JPG remains the safer and more practical
    choice. If you need to convert HEIC files quickly, <a href="/tools/heic">OpenedFile's HEIC
    to JPG converter</a> handles the conversion directly in your browser without uploading files
    to any server.
  </p>

  <h2>Feature Comparison</h2>
  <p>
    Beyond basic image storage, HEIC supports several features that JPG simply cannot match:
  </p>
  <h3>Transparency (Alpha Channel)</h3>
  <p>
    HEIC supports alpha channels for transparency, similar to PNG. JPG does not support
    transparency at all. If you need a compressed photo with transparent areas, HEIC is one of
    the few lossy formats that can accommodate this.
  </p>
  <h3>Animation and Image Sequences</h3>
  <p>
    A single HEIC file can contain multiple images stored as a sequence, enabling photo bursts
    and animations to be stored in one container. JPG is strictly a single-image format.
  </p>
  <h3>Depth Maps</h3>
  <p>
    iPhone Portrait Mode photos include depth map data that enables the background blur effect.
    HEIC can store this depth information alongside the image. JPG cannot carry auxiliary depth data.
  </p>
  <h3>Color Depth</h3>
  <p>
    HEIC supports up to 16-bit color depth, while JPG is limited to 8-bit. This means HEIC can
    represent a wider range of colors and tonal values, which is particularly beneficial for HDR
    photography and professional editing workflows.
  </p>
  <h3>Non-Destructive Edits</h3>
  <p>
    HEIC files can store editing instructions (like crops and rotations) non-destructively within
    the container, preserving the original image data. JPG edits always require re-encoding and
    introduce additional quality loss.
  </p>

  <h2>When to Use HEIC</h2>
  <p>
    HEIC is the best choice in the following scenarios:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You are storing photos on an Apple device and want to maximize storage space</li>
    <li>You need to preserve transparency in a lossy compressed image</li>
    <li>You are working within the Apple ecosystem where compatibility is not a concern</li>
    <li>You want to keep depth map and HDR data with your photos</li>
    <li>You are archiving photos and want the best quality-to-size ratio</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When to Use JPG</h2>
  <p>
    JPG is the better choice in these situations:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You are sharing photos with people on different platforms</li>
    <li>You are uploading images to websites or web applications</li>
    <li>You need maximum compatibility with older software or devices</li>
    <li>You are sending images via email to recipients who may not have HEIC support</li>
    <li>You are publishing images that need to work everywhere without conversion</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Convert Between HEIC and JPG</h2>
  <p>
    Converting between these formats is straightforward. If you have HEIC files that you need in
    JPG format, you can use <a href="/tools/heic">OpenedFile's free HEIC to JPG/PNG converter</a>.
    It works entirely in your browser, meaning your photos are never uploaded to a remote server.

    (JPG or PNG), select a quality level, and download the converted files. The process is fast,
    private, and requires no software installation.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    HEIC and JPG each have distinct strengths. HEIC delivers superior compression efficiency,
    better quality at smaller file sizes, and advanced features like transparency, depth maps,
    and 16-bit color. JPG offers unmatched universal compatibility that no other format can rival.
  </p>
  <p>
    For most people, the best approach is to use both formats strategically. Keep your photos in
    HEIC on your Apple devices to save storage, and convert to JPG when you need to share or
    publish those images outside the Apple ecosystem. With tools like
    <a href="/tools/heic">OpenedFile</a>, switching between the two is quick and effortless.
