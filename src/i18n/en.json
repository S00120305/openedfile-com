        "question": "What is a winmail.dat file?",
        "answer": "A winmail.dat file is created by Microsoft Outlook when it sends emails using TNEF (Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format). This format bundles the email body, formatting, and attachments into a single binary file. Email clients other than Outlook can't decode this format, so they display it as a generic \"winmail.dat\" attachment."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it safe to open winmail.dat files with this tool?",
        "answer": "Yes, completely safe. This tool parses the file entirely in your browser — no data is sent to any server. If the file contains HTML email content, it is sanitized with DOMPurify and displayed in a sandboxed iframe to prevent any potential security risks."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do I keep receiving winmail.dat files?",
        "answer": "You receive winmail.dat files when someone sends you an email from Microsoft Outlook configured to use Rich Text Format (RTF). The TNEF encoding wraps the email content and attachments into a single file that non-Outlook clients can't read. You can ask the sender to switch to HTML or Plain Text format in their Outlook settings."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I extract attachments from winmail.dat?",
        "answer": "Yes! This tool extracts all embedded attachments from the winmail.dat file. You'll see each attachment listed with its original file name and size. You can download them individually or all at once as a ZIP archive."
      },
      {
        "question": "What types of content can be inside a winmail.dat file?",
        "answer": "A winmail.dat file can contain the email subject, sender and recipient information, the email body (in plain text and/or HTML format), and any file attachments. Common attachments include documents (PDF, Word, Excel), images, and other files that were sent with the original email."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I prevent sending winmail.dat files?",
        "answer": "If you use Microsoft Outlook, go to File > Options > Mail, and under \"Compose messages in this format\", select \"HTML\" or \"Plain Text\" instead of \"Rich Text\". You can also change the format for individual contacts by editing their contact card and selecting \"Internet Format: Send Plain Text Only\"."

      {
        "question": "What is the difference between JPG and PNG output?",
        "answer": "JPG (JPEG) uses lossy compression, which means file sizes are smaller but some image detail may be lost. It's best for photographs. PNG uses lossless compression, preserving all image details and supporting transparency. It's ideal for graphics, screenshots, and images with text."
      },
      {
        "question": "What quality setting should I use for JPG?",
        "answer": "A quality of 90% provides an excellent balance between file size and visual quality. For web use, 80-85% is often sufficient. If you need the highest possible quality, use 100%, though the file size will be larger. For PNG output, quality settings don't apply since PNG is lossless."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a file size limit?",
        "answer": "There is no strict file size limit since all processing happens in your browser. However, very large files (over 100MB) may cause your browser to slow down. For files over 500MB, your browser may run out of memory. We recommend converting large files one at a time."

        "question": "Can I convert multiple WebP files at once?",
        "answer": "Yes! You can drag and drop multiple WebP files at once, or select multiple files from the file browser. All files will be converted with the same settings, and you can download them individually or as a single ZIP archive."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why can't I open WebP files on my computer?",
        "answer": "WebP is a relatively new image format created by Google. While modern browsers and operating systems support it, some older applications and systems don't. Converting to JPG or PNG ensures your images can be opened by virtually any image viewer or editor."

        "answer": "HEIC (High Efficiency Image Container) is a modern image format based on the HEVC (H.265) video codec. Apple adopted it as the default photo format on iPhones starting with iOS 11 because it produces files roughly 50% smaller than equivalent JPGs while maintaining the same or better image quality. This saves significant storage space on your device."

      {
        "question": "Is it safe to convert HEIC files with this tool?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Will I lose image quality when converting from HEIC to JPG?",
        "answer": "Converting from HEIC to JPG involves re-encoding, so there is a minimal quality loss inherent to lossy compression. However, at the default quality setting of 90%, the difference is virtually imperceptible to the human eye. For truly lossless conversion, choose PNG as the output format."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert HEIC photos from my iPhone on a Windows PC?",
        "answer": "Yes! That's one of the primary use cases for this tool. Simply transfer your HEIC photos from your iPhone to your Windows PC (via USB, email, cloud storage, etc.), then use this tool to convert them to JPG or PNG. No additional software installation is needed — just your web browser."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I stop my iPhone from taking photos in HEIC format?",
        "answer": "You can change your iPhone's camera format by going to Settings > Camera > Formats, and selecting \"Most Compatible\" instead of \"High Efficiency\". This will make your iPhone save photos as JPG instead of HEIC. However, keep in mind that JPG files are roughly twice the size of HEIC files."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert multiple HEIC files at once?",
        "answer": "Yes! You can select or drag and drop multiple HEIC files simultaneously. All files will be converted with your chosen settings, and you can download them individually or as a single ZIP archive for convenience."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between HEIC and HEIF?",
        "answer": "HEIF (High Efficiency Image Format) is the broader standard, while HEIC is specifically HEIF using HEVC compression. In practice, .heic and .heif files are essentially the same thing and this tool handles both formats identically."
