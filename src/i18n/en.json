This format bundles the email body, formatting, and attachments into a single binary file. Email clients other than Outlook can't decode this format, so they display it as a generic \"winmail.dat\" attachment."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it safe to open winmail.dat files with this tool?",
        "answer": "Yes, completely safe. This tool parses the file entirely in your browser — no data is sent to any server. If the file contains HTML email content, it is sanitized with DOMPurify and displayed in a sandboxed iframe to prevent any potential security risks."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do I keep receiving winmail.dat files?",
        "answer": "You receive winmail.dat files when someone sends you an email from Microsoft Outlook configured to use Rich Text Format (RTF). The TNEF encoding wraps the email content and attachments into a single file that non-Outlook clients can't read. You can ask the sender to switch to HTML or Plain Text format in their Outlook settings."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I extract attachments from winmail.dat?",
        "answer": "Yes! This tool extracts all embedded attachments from the winmail.dat file. You'll see each attachment listed with its original file name and size. You can download them individually or all at once as a ZIP archive."
      },
      {
        "question": "What types of content can be inside a winmail.dat file?",
        "answer": "A winmail.dat file can contain the email subject, sender and recipient information, the email body (in plain text and/or HTML format), and any file attachments. Common attachments include documents (PDF, Word, Excel), images, and other files that were sent with the original email."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I prevent sending winmail.dat files?",
        "answer": "If you use Microsoft Outlook, go to File > Options > Mail, and under \"Compose messages in this format\", select \"HTML\" or \"Plain Text\" instead of \"Rich Text\". You can also change the format for individual contacts by editing their contact card and selecting \"Internet Format: Send Plain Text Only\"."

        "question": "What is the difference between JPG and PNG output?",
        "answer": "JPG (JPEG) uses lossy compression, which means file sizes are smaller but some image detail may be lost. It's best for photographs. PNG uses lossless compression, preserving all image details and supporting transparency. It's ideal for graphics, screenshots, and images with text."
      },
      {
        "question": "What quality setting should I use for JPG?",
        "answer": "A quality of 90% provides an excellent balance between file size and visual quality. For web use, 80-85% is often sufficient. If you need the highest possible quality, use 100%, though the file size will be larger. For PNG output, quality settings don't apply since PNG is lossless."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a file size limit?",
        "answer": "There is no strict file size limit since all processing happens in your browser. However, very large files (over 100MB) may cause your browser to slow down. For files over 500MB, your browser may run out of memory. We recommend converting large files one at a time."

      {
        "question": "Why can't I open WebP files on my computer?",
        "answer": "WebP is a relatively new image format created by Google. While modern browsers and operating systems support it, some older applications and systems don't. Converting to JPG or PNG ensures your images can be opened by virtually any image viewer or editor."

        "answer": "HEIC (High Efficiency Image Container) is a modern image format based on the HEVC (H.265) video codec. Apple adopted it as the default photo format on iPhones starting with iOS 11 because it produces files roughly 50% smaller than equivalent JPGs while maintaining the same or better image quality. This saves significant storage space on your device."

      },
      {
        "question": "Will I lose image quality when converting from HEIC to JPG?",
        "answer": "Converting from HEIC to JPG involves re-encoding, so there is a minimal quality loss inherent to lossy compression. However, at the default quality setting of 90%, the difference is virtually imperceptible to the human eye. For truly lossless conversion, choose PNG as the output format."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert HEIC photos from my iPhone on a Windows PC?",
        "answer": "Yes! That's one of the primary use cases for this tool. Simply transfer your HEIC photos from your iPhone to your Windows PC (via USB, email, cloud storage, etc.), then use this tool to convert them to JPG or PNG. No additional software installation is needed — just your web browser."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I stop my iPhone from taking photos in HEIC format?",
        "answer": "You can change your iPhone's camera format by going to Settings > Camera > Formats, and selecting \"Most Compatible\" instead of \"High Efficiency\". This will make your iPhone save photos as JPG instead of HEIC. However, keep in mind that JPG files are roughly twice the size of HEIC files."

      {
        "question": "Can I convert multiple HEIC files at once?",

      {
        "question": "What's the difference between HEIC and HEIF?",
        "answer": "HEIF (High Efficiency Image Format) is the broader standard, while HEIC is specifically HEIF using HEVC compression. In practice, .heic and .heif files are essentially the same thing and this tool handles both formats identically."

It's used by virtually every contact management system, including Apple Contacts, Google Contacts, Microsoft Outlook, and smartphone address books. A single VCF file can contain one contact or hundreds of contacts, each with information like name, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, and organization details.\n\nWhile VCF files are great for transferring contacts between devices and applications, they aren't easy to open or edit directly. Our VCF to CSV converter parses your contact file entirely in your browser and displays all contacts in a clean, readable table. You can then export the data as a CSV file that opens perfectly in Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc, and other spreadsheet applications. The CSV is exported with a UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark) to ensure special characters and international names display correctly in Excel.\n\nThis tool is ideal for migrating contacts between platforms, creating mailing lists, auditing contact data, or simply viewing the contents of a VCF file without importing it into your address book.",

        "answer": "Yes, completely safe. The VCF file is parsed entirely in your browser — no contact data is sent to any server. Your names, phone numbers, email addresses, and other personal information remain completely private on your device throughout the entire process."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will the CSV file open correctly in Excel?",
        "answer": "Yes! The CSV file is exported with UTF-8 encoding and a BOM (Byte Order Mark), which ensures Microsoft Excel correctly recognizes the character encoding. This means special characters, accented letters, and characters from non-Latin scripts (Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Arabic, etc.) will display correctly when you open the file in Excel."

        "question": "Can I convert a VCF file with multiple contacts?",
        "answer": "Yes! VCF files can contain a single contact or hundreds of contacts. This tool parses all contacts in the file and displays them in a table. The exported CSV will include all contacts, one per row, making it easy to work with large contact lists."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I export contacts as VCF from my phone?",
        "answer": "On iPhone, go to Contacts, select a contact, tap 'Share Contact', and choose to save or send the VCF file. For all contacts, use iCloud.com. On Android, open Contacts, go to Settings or Manage Contacts, and select 'Export' to save all contacts as a single VCF file. Google Contacts also allows export from contacts.google.com."

      {
        "question": "What information is included in the CSV export?",
        "answer": "The CSV export includes columns for Name, Email, Phone, Address, and Organization. If a contact has multiple email addresses or phone numbers, they are combined in the respective field. The CSV format is compatible with all major spreadsheet applications."

        "question": "Does this tool work on mobile devices?",
