While WebP files are significantly smaller in size, they aren't universally supported by all applications and platforms. If you've downloaded a WebP image from the web and can't open it in your image editor, or need to share it with someone whose device doesn't support WebP, this tool makes conversion quick and easy.\n\nOur WebP converter runs entirely in your browser using the HTML5 Canvas API. This means your images are never uploaded to any server — they stay on your device throughout the entire conversion process.",

        "description": "If you've selected JPG as the output format, you can adjust the quality slider from 0% to 100%. A quality of 90% offers an excellent balance between file size and visual quality. Lower values produce smaller files but with some loss of detail."

      {
        "question": "Is it safe to convert WebP files with this tool?",
        "answer": "Yes, absolutely. This tool processes all files locally in your browser. Your images are never uploaded to any server. The conversion uses your browser's built-in Canvas API, so your files never leave your device."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between JPG and PNG output?",
        "answer": "JPG (JPEG) uses lossy compression, which means file sizes are smaller but some image detail may be lost. It's best for photographs. PNG uses lossless compression, preserving all image details and supporting transparency. It's ideal for graphics, screenshots, and images with text."
      },
      {
        "question": "What quality setting should I use for JPG?",
        "answer": "A quality of 90% provides an excellent balance between file size and visual quality. For web use, 80-85% is often sufficient. If you need the highest possible quality, use 100%, though the file size will be larger. For PNG output, quality settings don't apply since PNG is lossless."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a file size limit?",
        "answer": "There is no strict file size limit since all processing happens in your browser. However, very large files (over 100MB) may cause your browser to slow down. For files over 500MB, your browser may run out of memory. We recommend converting large files one at a time."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert multiple WebP files at once?",
        "answer": "Yes! You can drag and drop multiple WebP files at once, or select multiple files from the file browser. All files will be converted with the same settings, and you can download them individually or as a single ZIP archive."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why can't I open WebP files on my computer?",
        "answer": "WebP is a relatively new image format created by Google. While modern browsers and operating systems support it, some older applications and systems don't. Converting to JPG or PNG ensures your images can be opened by virtually any image viewer or editor."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this tool work offline?",
        "answer": "Once the page has loaded, the conversion tool works without an internet connection. However, you'll need an internet connection to initially load the page. Since all processing is done locally, the speed of conversion doesn't depend on your internet speed."

      {
        "question": "What is HEIC and why does my iPhone use it?",
        "answer": "HEIC (High Efficiency Image Container) is a modern image format based on the HEVC (H.265) video codec. Apple adopted it as the default photo format on iPhones starting with iOS 11 because it produces files roughly 50% smaller than equivalent JPGs while maintaining the same or better image quality. This saves significant storage space on your device."

      {
        "question": "Is it safe to convert HEIC files with this tool?",
        "answer": "Yes, completely safe. This tool processes all files locally in your browser using WebAssembly technology. Your photos are never uploaded to any server — they remain entirely on your device throughout the conversion process. No one else can see or access your photos."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will I lose image quality when converting from HEIC to JPG?",
        "answer": "Converting from HEIC to JPG involves re-encoding, so there is a minimal quality loss inherent to lossy compression. However, at the default quality setting of 90%, the difference is virtually imperceptible to the human eye. For truly lossless conversion, choose PNG as the output format."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert HEIC photos from my iPhone on a Windows PC?",
        "answer": "Yes! That's one of the primary use cases for this tool. Simply transfer your HEIC photos from your iPhone to your Windows PC (via USB, email, cloud storage, etc.), then use this tool to convert them to JPG or PNG. No additional software installation is needed — just your web browser."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I stop my iPhone from taking photos in HEIC format?",
        "answer": "You can change your iPhone's camera format by going to Settings > Camera > Formats, and selecting \"Most Compatible\" instead of \"High Efficiency\". This will make your iPhone save photos as JPG instead of HEIC. However, keep in mind that JPG files are roughly twice the size of HEIC files."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert multiple HEIC files at once?",
        "answer": "Yes! You can select or drag and drop multiple HEIC files simultaneously. All files will be converted with your chosen settings, and you can download them individually or as a single ZIP archive for convenience."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between HEIC and HEIF?",
        "answer": "HEIF (High Efficiency Image Format) is the broader standard, while HEIC is specifically HEIF using HEVC compression. In practice, .heic and .heif files are essentially the same thing and this tool handles both formats identically."
